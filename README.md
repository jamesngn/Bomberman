# Bomber Man Game

## Description

The Bomber Man Game is a custom program designed based on the childhood game 'Bomber man'. In this game, the player becomes a bomber who can place bombs on squares of the map to kill enemies. The bomb has a 2-3 seconds delay before it explodes. The explosion occurs in the 'cross' direction, destroying players, enemies, and breakable blocks in its path. 

When the breakable blocks are destroyed by the bombs, special items may be produced, such as bomb radius enhancer, bomb counter enhancer, or speed boost, which power up the player. The player wins the game by eliminating all enemies. However, if the player loses all health points (HP) by touching an enemy or bomb explosion, the game is lost.
